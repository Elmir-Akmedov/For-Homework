#G. You have the following dictionary:
#car = {
#    "brand": "Chevrolet",
#    "model": "Camaro",
#    "year": 2017
#}
#
#Create a 'not_found_message' variable. Make it equal appropriate "not found" message.
#Try to get 'year's and 'color's values from the 'car'. Set the default value to 
#our "not found" message.
#H. Print the first 6 keys from the following dictionary (hint: you should use 
#'list()' method to convert dict_keys to list and indexing to get the appropriate
#portion of data):
#countries_capitals = {
#    "USA": "Washington, D.C.",
#    "Canada": "Ottawa",
#    "United Kingdom": "London",

#selected_person = "Alice"
#new_task = "Go to the gym"
#
#Add the new task to the selected person's tasks. Print the tasks & length of tasks 
#before and after edition.
#K. There is a dictionary method that helps to create a dictionary with a collection
#of keys and apply a default value to that key. Using that method create a dictionary
#with all values equal to the '[0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]' list and keys should only be
#the numbers from 0 to 4, so your dictionary should look like:
#digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
#my_dict = {
#    0: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#    1: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#    2: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#    3: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#    4: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#}
#
#You should use list comprehension in this task.
#
#Then you should print some portion from the list values of a dictionary. The
#portion size depends on a key you are using to index the list.
#L. Print all items, values, keys from 'programming_languages' dictionary.
#M. Remove 'Java' from 'programming_languages' dictionary & get its value. Print it.
#N. Remove the last item from the following dictionary and print it:
#car = {
#    "brand": "Ford",
#    "model": "Mustang",
#    "year": 1964
#}
#O. Expand 'programming_languages' dictionary with the following data:
#language_to_add = {
#    "PHP": {
#        "designed_by": "Rasmus Lerdorf",
#        "first_appeared": 1995,
#        "paradigm": "Server-side scripting",
#        "typing": "Dynamic",
#        "popularity": "Moderate"
#    }
#}
#P. Use 'setdefault' method on any dictionary.
#Q. Which Data Types can be represented as values of any dictionary?
#R. In the following example:
#data = {
#    "Python3.x": {
#        "Wep Development", "Machine Learning", "Penetration Testing", "Game Development"
#    }
#}
#
#It's giving an error if you try to get 'Python2.x' in this way:
#data["Python2.x"]
#Edit this code so it doesn't return an error.
