#- Strings -
#A. Create a variable called 'long_sentence'. Make it equal a sentence minimum. Print 'long_sentence's length.
long_sentence = "sentence minimum"
print(len(long_sentence))

#B. Replace Print function's 'end' parameter from default '\n' to '\t'. Write 2 Print functions with it.
fruit = "apple"
fruit2 = "melon"
print(fruit, end="\t")
print(fruit2)

#C. Change Print function's 'end' parameter, so that it links values with stars. Example: Today*is*a*good*day!
print("Today", end="*")
print("is", end="*")
print("a", end="*",)
print("good", end="*",)
print("day!")

#D. Write 3 different Print functions with according string ("He", "is", "cool.") in such way so you can see this on your console (you can use any method): He is cool.
print("He", end=" ")
print("is", end=" ")
print("cool.")

#E. The same task as previous (D), but now make it look like: He#is#cool.
print("He", end="#")
print("is", end="#")
print("cool.")

#F. Create a variable named 'color'. Give it a string 'Python' value.
color = "Python"

#G. Create a variable named 'item'. Give it a string 'Developer' value.
item = "Developer"

#H. Use all methods you know about string-formattings and Print function to concatenate these two variables, so you can see 'Python Developer' on your console (terminal).
#Metod 1
print(f"{color} {item}")
#Metod 2
print("{} {}".format(color, item))
#metod 3
print("%s %s" % (color, item))

#I. Replace Print function's 'end' parameter from default value to '...'. Write 3 Print functions with it.
print("Bu" , end="...")
print("Ã§ox" , end="...")
print("yorucudur")
#J. Suppose you have the following variable: word = "Hello. I am Taylor."

#j
#Using slicing method:
#1. Create a variable called 'prefix'. Make it equal to 'Hello.' part of 'word' variable.
#2. Create a variable called 'middle_part'. Make it equal to ' I am ' part of 'word' variable.
#3. Create a variable called 'name'. Make it equal to 'Taylor.' part of 'word' variable.
#
#Create a variable named 'recreated_word' or 'result' and use all previous variables 
#(prefix, middle_part, name) to recreate the 'word' phrase.
word =  "Hello. I am Taylor"
        #012345678901234567
prefix = word[:6]
middle_part = word[6:12]
name = word[12:]
result = prefix + middle_part + name
print(result)
#K. Suppose you have the following value: "abababababa"
#
#Using slicing method, get all 'a' characters from the value and assign it to a variable, then print that variable.
word = "abababababa"
new_word = word[0::2]
print(new_word)

#L. Create a formula that finds the last index of a string.
word = "Elmir"
print(len(word) - 1)

#M. What is the difference between 1 and "1"? Are they equal values, why?
a = "1"
b = 1
print(type(a), type(b))

#N. Using all your Python knowledge, find the amount of words the following sentence:"The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers."
sentence = "The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers."
print(sentence.count(" ") + 1)

#- String Methods -

print(word.title())
#2. capitalize
print(word.capitalize())
#3. count
print(word.count("e"))
#4. endswith

#7. isalpha
print(word.isalpha())
#8. isdigit
print(word.isdigit())
#9. islower
print(word.islower())
#10. isupper
print(word.isupper())
#11. lower
word = "Elmir"
print(word.lower())
#12. upper
print(word.upper())
#13. replace
print(word.replace("E", "A"))
#14. split
word = "Elmir*Seymur"
print(word.split("*"))
#15. strip
word = "   Elmir"
print(word.strip())
#16. startswith
word = "Elmir"
print(word.startswith("*"))
#17. join
word = ("Elmir", "Seymur")
print("*".join(word))

#B. Combine several string methods at once.
word = "   elmir, how are you today?  "
new_word = word.strip().replace("today", "yesterday").capitalize()
print(new_word)

#C. Create any string-valued variable. First, call the 'lower' method on it, then call 'islower' method. What value will it always give you and why?
word = "Elmir"
print(word.islower())
print(word.lower().islower())

#D. Suppose you have the following variable: my_value = "Obviously, today is a hot day."Replace all 'o' characters with 0 (zeros). 
my_value = "Obviously, today is a hot day."
new_value = my_value.replace("o", "0")
print(new_value)

#E. Count how many times the word 'likes' occured in the following string: "Sammy likes to swim in the ocean, likes to spin up servers, and likes to smile."
print("Sammy likes to swim in the ocean, likes to spin up servers, and likes to smile.".count("likes"))

#- String Formattings -
#A. Create a variable 'name' and assign your name to it. Create a variable 'age' and assign your age to it. Using the f-string method, create a formatted string that displays your name  and age in the following format: "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."
name = "Elmir"
age = "19"
sentence = "My name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name, age)
print(sentence)

#B. Create a variable item and assign a string representing an item name. Create a variable quantity and assign an integer representing the quantity of the item. Create a formatted string using the old-style % formatting that displays the item  name and quantity in the following format: "I want to buy %d units of %s."
item = "pen"
quantity = 10
print( "I want to buy %d units of %s." % (quantity, item))

#C. Make your best and create a hard task by your own using string formattings.
